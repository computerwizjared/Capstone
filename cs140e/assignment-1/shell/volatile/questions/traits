You’ll notice that each type only implements one inherent method: new. The rest of a type’s methods come from implementations of the Readable, Writeable, and ReadableWriteable traits. What is the benefit to doing this? Describe at least two benefits to this approach.

The benefits to doing this is that they can be extended, so that the implementation can be modified, and they also reduce the amount of code needed in the implementation.
