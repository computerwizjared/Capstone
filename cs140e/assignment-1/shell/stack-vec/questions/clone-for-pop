The pop method from Vec<T> in the standard libary is implemented for all T, but the pop method from our StackVec is only implemented when T implements the Clone trait. Why might that be? What goes wrong when the bound is removed?

The item values must stay in the array if T doesn't implement Clone, since we can't legally make a copy of the value.
