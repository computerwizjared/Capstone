# Capstone | OS in Rust

Welcome to my Fall 2022 Honors Capstone project! Here you will find the source code to my basic OS written in Rust,
which is based off of Stanford's CS140e course located [here](https://cs140e.sergio.bz). This project is specifically written
for the Raspberry Pi 3B with the BCM2837 CPU in mind.

This capstone project is in partial fulfillment of the degree requirements for the
[Gordon &amp; Judy Dutile Honors Program](https://www.sbuniv.edu/academics/honors-program.php)
at [Southwest Baptist University](https://www.sbuniv.edu).

### Development Iterations

Development will occur in one-week iterations, beginning with the Stanford CS140e curriculum in mind,
then expanding upon it as time allows. All progress will be logged in this repository,
with source code and documentation included for each iteration. Near the end of the project, a paper will be written,
outlining the development process, as well as potential future applications for the project.
