# Assignment 1

I began this project by following the steps located at the CS140e course [here](https://cs140e.sergio.bz/assignments/1-shell/). All steps in this documentation are executed within the `cs140e/assignment-1` directory.

## Phase 0

First, I installed `socat`:

```
brew install socat
```

Then I cloned the "shell" skeleton project from the CS140e Git repository into this repository under the `shell` folder.

```
git clone https://cs140e.sergio.bz/assignments/1-shell/skeleton.git shell
rm -rf shell/.git
```

Then, I answered the question in the `shell/getting-started/questions/assignment0` file.
